    <h1>DEV-LOG ENTRY 6: API IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
    <p>
        APIs they can never make me love you! For real, you are such a pain. The stress you have given me is beyond 
        explainable. Every time I think about you there’s only one thought that crosses my mind, “Where do I start?”
    </p>

    <p>
        All jokes aside, APIs are a pain sometimes especially when you don’t know where to start or to look which was 
        a challenge I had for this website. I didn’t know which API would be suitable for my website because I do not 
        like implementing something for the sake of it and then it hit me! I can use an API for my portfolio! I know 
        what you're thinking, “It’s not your work or code”. I know but listen to my idea. What if just what if I had an 
        idea that makes this concept sound cool? So I went on and did my research and I found the perfect API!! Ready 
        3….2…..1….

        TA-DAAAAA!!! An Advice slip API. “Okay but how does this relate to it being in your portfolio?” So one cool fact 
        about me is I’m an older sibling, middle child but that’s not the point. The point is I can pass this API off as 
        the Big Sister API which generates advice that someone might need in life! Great Idea I know right, that older 
        sibling wisdom right there. The only issue is… how will I implement this because I struggle to do so. Well time 
        to go do more documentation surfing and go back to my lectures to find a suitable way to implement this idea. 
        TO THE STUDY DESK!!
