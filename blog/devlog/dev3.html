    <h1>DEV-LOG ENTRY 3: CODE REVIEW</h1>
    <p>Coding always comes with itâ€™s struggles. I cant always seems to find the best practices and sometimes the worst practices work- such as using VAR. I am very much aware that this is prone to errors but it was the only code that worked when I needed it to, so I ran with it. I did find better coding practices and implemented them to my JavaScript specifically so I did some code reviews with a peer and we looked at a piece of code and identified pros and cons and also researched good recommendations to improve the code, here are a few examples of the reviews we did for my code:</p>

    <h3>factgenerator.js</h3>
    <img src="../blog_images/factgeneratorcode.png" alt="image blogs-nav code snippet" class="responsive"  width="600" height="500">
    <img>
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
    <p>Array Usage: The use of an array to store random facts is appropriate and scalable.
    Random Index Generation: The method for generating a random index is efficient and ensures uniform distribution.
    Separation of Concerns: Functions generateRandomFact() and displayRandomFact() are well-separated, adhering to the single responsibility principle.</p>
    <h4>Cons:</h4>
    <p>Hardcoded Strings: The array facts contains hardcoded strings. Consider externalizing this data for easier maintenance.
    Potential Redundancy: The fact "Did I mention I love sleep?" is redundant since "I love sleep." is already present.
    getElementById Typo: Ensure there are no typos in your element IDs to avoid runtime errors. In the snippet provided, getElementById('fact-text') seems correct but double-check your HTML for consistency.</p>

    <h3>typewriter.js</h3>
    <img src="../blog_images/typewritercode-old.png" alt="image blogs-nav code snippet" class="responsive"  width="600" height="500">
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
    <p>Typewriter Effect: The typewriter effect is well-implemented with character-by-character display.
    Function Modularity: The typeWriter() function is self-contained and modular, making it easy to manage and update.
    Adjustable Speed: The use of setTimeout() allows for easy adjustment of typing speed and delay between texts.</p>
    <h4>Cons:</h4>
    <p>Global Variables: textIndex and charIndex are global. Encapsulate them within an object or function to avoid potential conflicts.
    Magic Numbers: Replace the 100 and 1000 in setTimeout with constants for better readability and maintainability.
    Hardcoded Strings: Similar to the previous file, consider externalizing the texts array for better scalability.</p>

    <h3>blogsnav.js</h3>
    <img src="../blog_images/blogsnav-old.png" alt="image blogs-nav code snippet" class="responsive"  width="600" height="500">
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
    <p>Event Listener: Proper use of DOMContentLoaded ensures the DOM is fully loaded before executing the script.
    Separation of Logic: The function buttonClickHandler() is well-defined separately from the event listener.</p>
    <h4>Cons:</h4>
    <p>Limited Functionality: The button click handler currently only shows an alert. Expand this functionality to make the button more useful.
    Hardcoded IDs: The script assumes the presence of an element with ID mybutton. Make sure this ID is correctly assigned in the HTML.
    Inline Function: Consider defining the event listener function separately rather than inline for better readability and potential reusability.</p>
