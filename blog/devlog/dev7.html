    <h1>DEV-LOG ENTRY 7: FINAL TOUCHES-THE LAST LAP</h1>
    <p>
        We’re almost there!! Just 2 more weeks then we have a complete website! Before I dive into the reflective 
        talky stuff, I just want to say- I’ve been in front of this screen for the longest time and I'm starting 
        to feel like my posture is terrible now. Thanks, School. Now back to why we’re here:
    </p>

    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <p>
        So looking back at all the feedback I have gathered from my rubrics and tutors and my users, the people who 
        are my test dummies and test all my work for me, I’m on the right track. The feedback for my creative aspect 
        was just to make my communication a lot clearer and to show more rather than tell or have a balance between 
        the two. I completely understand this because when the users were testing my side, some could navigate through 
        the design journal until I told them to hover over it. This helped me realise that sometimes telling the user 
        what to do isn’t bad, just don’t over-do it. The other feedback was basically improve your theory, reflect more 
        and other stuff, you know the drill. Nothing is perfect *shrugs shoulders*. Anyway now my games plan is:
    </p>

    <h3>Improvements</h3>
    <p>
        Listen to everything everyone said! That’s it, that’s the paragraph. Just kidding. The game plan is to try and 
        balance the focus on all aspects of the website. I do want to prioritize the technical followed by the creative 
        then the theory because I feel like if I have my technical on lock everything else falls into place and obviously 
        nothing practically works without theory so we cant really neglect that part, more reading! Yay! But I do love 
        doing research on UI and UX and design, and the psychology behind it so it wont be a hassle reading or doing 
        research. That my game plan we do more research and fix my current issues before adding new stuff to the mix or 
        else the plot will be lost and it will result in a panic attack which is not needed because too many panic attacks 
        have tried to put me to rest full time and I said not this year! Now all jokes aside and stuff lets get to work on 
        our last lap!
