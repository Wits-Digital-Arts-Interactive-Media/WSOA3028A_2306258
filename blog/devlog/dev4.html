    <h1>DEV-LOG ENTRY 4: FEATURE IDEAS AND IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
    <p>So we are here after getting code feedback, doing a code review and stuff. So what's something new and cool that I can implement? What do I want my website to have? What would make sense to have in my website? So I already have a few ideas in mind that I would like to implement. Idea one is obviously a flipbook that acts as a design journal, I think it’s a cool feature to have because I get to create this illusion or idea that this is the design book I write in, with a handwriting font and stuff to make it feel that way. Idea 2, because I have no idea how a person can open a C# project on the website why not give them the option to download the game project? Idea 3, now I know JavaScript can be a handful but why not use it in a clever way? Remember that website you looked at from the ones that were provided? There was a feature in there that stood out and it was a fact generator thingy. This is a cool feature you can implement in your profile section so the user can get to know you more.</p>
    <p> There are other features we can implement in the website such as including video that play demos of your projects.? Or even internet games the user can play just like the ones you created in your Internet art website! Maybe you want something different but I cant help you think of different now Fefe? Hellooo, Helloooo!! UGH I’m in my head again let me snap out of it and pick a feature I like the most</p> 
    <p>The feature I want my website to have is the Flipbook idea. I like the concept and idea I have surrounding it. It also adds a nice touch to my interaction design because the suer can interact with it by clicking on the pages to turn the pages. Doesn’t that sound cool? Okay looks at the vision:</p>
