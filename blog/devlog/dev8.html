    <h1>DEV-LOG ENTRY 8: FINAL REFLECTION</h1>
    <p>
        Finally!! The website is complete! Yay! It was a lot of hard work and pure survival but we made it. 
        Now it's time to write a project reflection which I always like to do at the end of my projects. 
        It’s a nice way to look back at my processes and how I overcame any challenges along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
        Creating this website was both exciting and challenging at the same time. It was nice creating a website 
        and learning new things along the way. I learned how to finally and confidently implement an API, 
        make use of a JavaScript plugin and understanding what each function does and just generally improving 
        my programming skills. The most challenging part of the project was having to find solutions to the 
        technical or creative issues I came across. I often went back to my class notes, took a look at my peers 
        works, requested feedback and did some research on how I can tackle these issues and find suitable 
        solutions to the problems.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
        Using these coding languages was quite fun and it was nice to improve my skills as I have worked with the 
        languages before. The most challenging one had to be JavaScript as I found it challenging to understand 
        what each function was doing, how to implement it and simply just understand the language. With constant 
        practice, research and making use of tutorials and documentation I managed to get the hang of it and find 
        solutions that helped with any JavaScript issues I came across. I enjoy using CSS as it allows me to bring 
        my creative side to the light and allows me to display my vision for my project. I did have many challenges 
        with CSS, not with understanding it, the challenge mainly arose when I didn’t know how to make something 
        responsive or why my site wasn’t rendering the way I wanted it to. I think I still have a lot to learn 
        regarding CSS, I am proud that I managed to get most of my vision done for my website. HTML is quite easy 
        to grasp. There is a lot to it such as semantic markup and making sure that your code is readable. I did 
        struggle with indenting my code as per the feedback received from my assignments leading up to the final. 
        Overall I think I’ve learned a lot more about the languages.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection on UI-UX</h3>
    <p>
        My UI and UX are quite decent. I do think it still needs to be worked on and improved a lot more. I managed 
        to explore my creative side when planning and designing the final look of the website. I do think I have not 
        fully made use of the knowledge obtained from course material and additional research when implementing designs 
        in my work. I think I disregarded some of the design principles or forgot to include them in my work, the UX does 
        lack a bit as some of the functions in the website don’t always work on the first load. The user would have to 
        refresh the page and then a certain function would work - this didn’t make my UX smooth and was a bit frustrating. 
        The UI is quite decent, from user feedback during my iteration phases - users found the pastel palette quite calming 
        and matched the aesthetic and theme I had going. I wanted to really emphasise my role as a young black woman in the 
        tech space and I did this by using images of black girls where applicable and made it the main image on my home page. 
        I tried my best to make the website accessible in every way by trying to go with a calm colour palette, use a readable 
        font and enhance features that show the user what they can interact with and what they can’t interact with. My UI/UX 
        skills still need improvement however I do think I did a great job on this front.
    </p>

    <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
    <p>
        Overall I think my website is quite decent, some hiccups here and there but it is mostly functional and the design came 
        out the way I wanted it to. I still need to improve on my technical skills to help enhance my creative skills as I do feel 
        like if I can feel invincible from a technical point of view, I would feel more confident in my creative design ideas. 
        Anyway thank you for joining my TED Talk! It’s super late and I’m tired… I have to submit this in a few hours. I hope all 
        goes well, because my mental health depends on it.
    </p>
