    <h1>DEV BLOG ENTRY 2:  JAVASCRIPT IMPLEMENTATION </h1>
    <p>I have worked with JavaScript before; this programming language was a very big challenge for me when I first started and progressed. I’ve learned to do my research and to keep practising my skills if I want to improve. This time around for this project I do feel confident in my JavaScript coding skills as I understand how functions and variables work, and which practices are good to work with and which ones are not recommended. I still have a lot of learning to do but I’ve constantly been doing research, watching tutorials that assist with making improvements as well as just practising and implementing the new functions I’ve learned. A good coding practice I’ve stopped neglecting is making use of a lot of comments in my work- I’ve noticed that whenever I use comments in my work, I understand what the code does better, and it also helps the next person looking at my work understand my thought process when focusing on the technical side of my work. Comments also help me break down different sections of code and make the code document look neater.</p>
    <p>For JavaScript, I want to implement something very creative and something I've never down before. I started researching creative ways to implement and use JavaScript in my website by looking at past students' work and just gathering inspiration from other portfolio websites. One feature stood out to me, and it was a “flipbook” feature that was implemented in one of the past students’ works. I thought this would be the perfect idea to implement for my design section as the flipbook can act as a design journal through which the user can flip through to explore and take a look at my ideas, thought process, style guide and inspirations- basically look at the idea on “paper” but digitally. Adding this feature would also help with enhancing my interaction design. The only challenge was then how would I implement this to my own website without heavily struggling to make it function.</p>
    <p>I then researched the flipbook feature and came across “Turn.js” which was something that I was looking for, Turn.js acts as a plugin for your JavaScript as the code is present on GitHub all I needed to do was implement the code into my website. This feature has different ideas, and variations of flipbook in which a developer can choose from- I decided to go with the basic one just for testing and iteration purposes. Implementing this code was a bit of a challenge due to my folder structure but I managed to get it to work however I came across a technical difficulty: when running the website through live sever the feature worked perfectly but when it wouldn’t work in my deployed website, and I struggled to understand why this was the case. I eventually figured that it was because the code is embedded deeply in folders in the entire project, I am still figuring out how to fix the issue but I think with constant code iteration I will be able to figure out how to fix the issue.</p>
