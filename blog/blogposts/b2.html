    <h1>Folder structure and Inspirations:</h1>
    <p>My folder structure would be simple and clear. I have one main project consisting of folders that cater to each aspect of my work, within the project I will have the index.html free floating on its own so that GitHub can find the starting page (I've had issues with this in the past where I placed the index into a folder and GitHub struggled to find my page). What I'd like to do is place all my HTML pages in one folder, the same goes for my JS and CSS folders as well as the images I will be using. Not only will this make it easier to find the files I'm looking for, but it will also make my project file look neater and readable.<p/>
        <p>The reading for the week was ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media’ by Moulthrop. In this reading, we further explore the idea of hypertext and the Laws of Media. A line that stood out for me was “Hypertext is all about connection, linkage, and affiliation.” (Moulthrop, 2003. P. 7). I agree with this statement as hypertext has made it easier to not only in some way store information, but it has made it easier to link information relating to what is being presented, hypertext has allowed us to in a way cross-reference between materials presented in technology. According to Moulthrop, hypertext is merely a recursion or extension of print and is not inherently novel. Users now have the power to create discourse rather than merely consume it, which is a new feature. There used to be an information hierarchy since only individuals with the necessary qualifications could publish written works (on paper). Engaging with this reading has allowed me to further research examples of hypertext to help me understand the concept better, these examples include interactive eBooks, HTML webpages, Online shopping websites and Blog posts with embedded links. </p>
        <p>Interaction from my understanding is being able to engage with something that is presented to you, in this case, the Internet. Interacting with the internet could mean looking up your favourite band on Google or clicking various links which redirect you to a website. Interaction is essentially communication between two people or things or in our case a computer and a human (alias surfing the internet). Interaction for me is quite important especially from a UI/UX perspective because if it is easy to interact with and engage with a webpage not only will it attract a user it will enhance the user experience when interacting with the webpage.</p>
        
        <p>These are the following websites that have influenced/inspired what I would like my website to look like (I wanted to explore portfolio websites to get a better idea of what I can implement:</p>
        <p>Eve Kayser’s portfolio website: The website has cool animations that I would like to attempt to implement in my website- https://www.evekayser.com.br/   </p>
        <p>Denys Mishunov’s website: An extremely colourful and fun website which perfectly highlights his work and his skills - https://mishunov.me/ </p>
        <p>Martin Gauer’s website: I found this website extremely creative, I have never seen anything like it, it was a creative way of displaying the skills one possesses and it is communicated well from the start page of the website-  https://martingauer.com/  </p>
