    <h1>Decolonising Technology:</h1>
    <p>Decolonising technology refers to efforts aimed at addressing and dismantling the colonial biases and power structures embedded within technological systems, practices, and institutions. This concept recognizes that technology, like other aspects of society, can reflect and perpetuate inequalities and injustices rooted in colonial histories.</p>
<p>The article "Algorithmic Colonization of Africa" by Abeba Birhane discusses how Western tech monopolies perpetuate a new form of colonialism through their control of digital ecosystems and infrastructure in Africa. Unlike traditional colonialism, which was driven by political and governmental forces using physical domination, this new form of colonialism is propelled by corporate interests and uses technological means to exert control.</p>
<p>From the reading these are the key points can note:</p>
<p>Corporate Tech Monopolies: Companies like Facebook, Google, Uber, and Netflix have significant influence over Africa's digital infrastructure. They present their interventions as beneficial technological solutions, such as mapping population densities or connecting the unconnected, but these actions often echo colonial rhetoric and justify data extraction for profit.</p>
<p>Impact on Local Development: The import of Western technology and AI solutions hampers the development of local products and makes African countries dependent on Western software and infrastructure. This technological dependency stifles local innovation and the growth of local tech industries.</p>
<p>Reduction of Social Problems to Data: The article criticizes the reduction of complex social, cultural, and political problems to data points that can be managed by algorithms. This approach treats people as passive objects for manipulation rather than active participants with their own agency and contextual needs.</p>
<p>Need for Context-Aware AI: The article advocates for AI and technological solutions that are developed with a deep understanding of local contexts, needs, and values. It calls for a rejection of the current business model of tech monopolies in favor of approaches that prioritize the well-being and consent of individuals.</p>
<p>Ethno-computing is an interdisciplinary field that explores the intersection of computer science and various cultural practices, particularly focusing on how computational concepts and techniques can be understood and applied within different cultural contexts</p>
<p>The document "Culturally Situated Design Tools: Ethnocomputing from Field Site to Classroom" by Ron Eglash et al. (2008) explores the concept and application of Culturally Situated Design Tools (CSDTs), which are web-based software tools that allow students to create simulations of cultural artifacts using underlying mathematical principles.</p>
<p>Ethnomathematics: The study of mathematical practices in cultural contexts.</p>
<p>CSDTs: Tools that let students simulate cultural arts such as Native American beadwork, African American cornrow hairstyles, and urban graffiti, emphasizing the cultural roots of the mathematical concepts involved.</p>
<p>Anthropological Issues</p>
<p>Representation: The project addresses the challenge of representing cultural knowledge accurately in the design process, involving community members in the creation of these tools.</p>
<p>Pedagogical Integration: It highlights the negotiation of educational features with math teachers and students to ensure these tools are effectively integrated into the curriculum.</p>
<p>Software Development: The software itself is viewed as a cultural construction, reflecting the interplay between computing, cultural anthropology, and math education.</p>
<p>Educational Impact</p>
<p>Cultural Relevance: By connecting cultural heritage with mathematical concepts, CSDTs aim to make learning more relevant for minority students, potentially improving academic achievement and interest in STEM careers.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Cornrow Curves: Utilizes the fractal patterns in cornrow hairstyles to teach concepts of fractal geometry, showing both the African cultural origins and contemporary African American innovations.</p>
<p>Virtual Bead Loom: Allows simulations of Native American beadwork, addressing cultural representations and intertribal considerations.</p>
<p>Graffiti Grapher: Engages students with the mathematical principles in graffiti art, blending youth subculture with formal education.</p>
<p>Theoretical and Practical Implications</p>
<p>Ethnocomputing: Extends ethnomathematics to computational media, providing a platform for exploring cultural and technological hybridity.</p>
<p>Identity and Achievement: CSDTs are seen as tools to bridge cultural identity and academic success, particularly addressing the cultural barriers that minority students might face in traditional educational settings.</p>
<p>Preliminary Results: Initial studies show significant improvements in grades and interest in STEM fields among minority students using CSDTs, although further research is needed to confirm these findings on a larger scale.</p>
<p>Challenges and Future Directions</p>
<p>Teacher Implementation: The effectiveness of CSDTs can vary based on the teacher's ability to integrate these tools into the classroom.</p>
<p>Cultural Sensitivity: Ensuring the tools respect and accurately represent the cultural practices they are based on remains a critical concern.</p>
<p>Broad Application: More extensive testing and adaptation are necessary to understand how these tools can be generalized across different educational contexts and cultural groups.</p>
