        <h1>Essay 2: Digital Colonialism</h1>
        <article>
            <p>“Digital colonialism is the term used to describe the present "Scramble for Africa," in which major internet companies acquire, analyse, and profit from user data for their own market dominance and profit, with little to no value to the data source.” (Dahiya 2023)</p>

            <p>The idea of digital colonialism is similar to historical colonialism, in which strong nations (Northern countries) oppressed weaker regions (Southern countries) for their own strategic and economic benefit. Some key components of digital (tech) colonialism include control over Digital Infrastructure, Data exploitation, Digital divide and economic dependence.</p>

            <p>“Google lays off hundreds of ‘Core’ employees, moves some positions to India and Mexico” is an article that discusses how Google is laying off “at least 200 employees from its “Core” organisation and as part of the unit’s rearrangement, the company will hire corresponding roles in Mexico and India.” (Elias, 2024).</p>

            <p>The essay below will discuss and further elaborate on what digital colonialism by using Sareeta Amrute’s article “Tech Colonialism Today” (2019) as well as other academic sources to discuss the topic while drawing some ideas and examples from these sources to help substantiate points. Examples from modern day situations will be included to help relate the concept of digital colonialism to labour situations in global software development as well as the South African development industry. The essay will then close by noting my understanding of the software development sector and understanding my role decoloniality of this sector.</p>

            <p>Amrute begins her article by defining what colonialism is. She notes that the standard definition is “too limited to represent the fill range of effects that are part of the structure of colonial relationships.” (Amrute 2019). Which leads to her noting that “Colonialism is a relationship, rather than a historical time period or even an unchanging system of oppression.” (Amrute 2019). She explores modern analogies of colonialism in the context of technology, making the case that the present tech sector demonstrates traits of colonial relationships. Amrute breaks down the concept into three key characteristics: hierarchical, extractive and exploitive relationships.</p>

            <p>In tech colonialism, Amrute uses the term "techno-chauvinism" to identify hierarchical hierarchies, this term refers to the belief held by a primarily “Silicon Valley-based”, rather similar set of technologists that their discoveries in algorithms and computations hold the key to solving the greatest challenges facing the globe. Because of the sense of superiority this idea promotes over other cultures and societies, current social and economic hierarchies are maintained. The views and ideals of Western, especially American, innovators are frequently favored by the global tech industry. Technology may not take into account or appropriately address the requirements and situations of non-Western users as a result of this bias. Moreover, technologists trained in elite universities in nations such as India might likewise hold similar hierarchical perspectives, reinforcing these tendencies internationally.</p>

            <p>The extractive character of digital (Tech) colonialism is clear in many aspects: Material, Knowledge and Data extraction. From a material point of view Amrute notes that a lot of the hardware used for digital devices relies on minerals that are generally mined from the global South, this process often mirrors historical colonial practices were resources would be extracted from colonised countries to profit the colonising country. Knowledge extraction: Corporations frequently appropriate intellectual and cultural resources from different groups for financial gain, such as native plant knowledge, with little benefit returned to the original community. The data extraction is the most discussed aspect of tech colonialism as we are now in a society that is becoming technology driven. Globally, businesses collect massive amounts of personal data from users, frequently without their express agreement or just compensation. Then, by using this data to generate profit for these businesses, power disagreements and economic inequalities are reinforced.</p>

            <p>Finally, Amrute explores how the exploitive characteristic of digital colonialism sustains exploitive labour practices such as “outsourcing and gig economy (a free market system where businesses frequently use independent contractors for brief assignments and temporary roles are common.)” (Amrute 2019). In her article "Digital Colonialism: The 21st Century Scramble for Africa through the Extraction and Control of User Data and the Limitations of Data Protection Laws", Danielle Coleman explores how Western technology companies are exploiting user data from African countries which is a mirror to historical colonial exploitation patterns. Key points that Coleman notes how lack of data protection- “Numerous Northern businesses profit on the personal information they gather from throughout the globe, jeopardizing the digital security of governments in the Global South and repeating historical patterns of resource exploitation associated with colonialism” (Dahiya 2023), corporate power, limitations of data protection laws and historical contact all contribute to exploitive nature of digital colonialism. Amrute also highlights how the consequences of these hierarchical, extractive, and exploitative relationships are unevenly distributed.</p>

            <p>In her article “Digital Colonialism: Neo-Colonialism of the Global South” Bhavna Dahiya references Eduardo Galeano description of economic exploitation of Latin America by the colonial powers of the Global North and notes that “this idea today can be viewed as “digital veins” which is connecting a tech ecosystem owned and controlled by a small number of primarily US-based firms, but with the same intention of exploitation of the neo-colonised.” (Dahiya 2023). The same can be said for the entire globe where the Global North turn to the Global South to seek resources to benefit them. To relate digital colonialism to the labour situation in global software development we take note that: in the IT sector, hierarchical structures are common, particularly in software development. Typically, teams in the Global North handle major decisions and high-level design work, while lower-level coding and maintenance are outsourced to the Global South. This ties into the techno-chauvinistic concept that the most important and creative work should be performed by the "best" (usually Western) brains, with regular work being assigned to less expensive labour markets.</p>

            <p>Here are some examples to highlight and relate digital colonialism to labour situations in global software development: The first example being Facebook's Free Basics Initiative, this initiative is aimed to give developing nations free access to the internet by providing a small number of websites and services. Because it limited users to Facebook-approved content, limited their access to the wider internet, and essentially promoted Facebook's ecosystem above local content and services, critics claimed that this amounted to digital colonialism. This led to a reliance on Facebook and sparked worries about information access manipulation and privacy. (Sen, Ahmad, Phokeer, Farooq, Qazi, Choffnes, Gummadi 2017)</p>

            <p>The second example is: Microsoft and Global education- Microsoft has been actively promoting its educational platforms and tools, like Teams and Microsoft Office 365, in classrooms all around the world. This can improve educational materials, but it can also cause a dependency on Microsoft's ecosystem, which would minimize other local software options and give Microsoft control over educational data. This dominance has the potential to hinder the advancement of regional educational technologies and extend a vicious cycle in which educational institutions and students grow reliant on Microsoft goods. We saw the shift from physical learning to online learning and the dependence of Software and technology for education in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic shook the globe.</p>

            <p>Another example is Uber's Market Entry Strategies. Uber often uses tough strategies to challenge regional ride-hailing firms while expanding into markets in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. This may result in the formation of a dominant position and the displacement of regional rivals. Concerns regarding confidentiality and privacy are also raised by the fact that Uber frequently processes and controls the data it collects from these locations outside of local laws. “Uber’s business strategy has four basic phases. One is a strategy for entering and penetrating markets with the objective of quickly winning the market and emerging as the dominant firm.” (Baron 2018)</p>

            <p>These instances show how significant software corporations from technologically powerful nations control platforms, infrastructure, and data; this is an example of digital colonialism that frequently results in economic dependency, data exploitation, and cultural influence over less developed places.</p>

            <p>“SA has the biggest information technology (IT) industry in Africa. Software development is one of the major services provided by this industry.” (Shongwe 2017). Much like any software development organisation around the globe in the South African software development industry also encounters failures. Applying Amrute's insights on tech colonialism to the software development sector in South Africa brings to light certain regional dynamics as well as world effects. The connections between them include:</p>

            <p>Hierarchical structures- Local vs Global work: A substantial amount of the high-level software development labour in South Africa is managed by global firms with headquarters in the Global North. Because local developers frequently work on maintenance or lower-level coding projects, hierarchical labour patterns are strengthened.</p>

            <p>Extractive practices- Labour exploitation: Outsourcing software development often means obtaining labour at a discount from nations with less expensive labour markets. When compared to their counterparts in the Global North, programmers and developers in these nations usually labour in less favourable conditions—longer hours, lower compensation, and fewer benefits. Many companies overseas hire South Africans for remote jobs because it is cheaper to pay them rather the source employees from the Global North.</p>

            <p>Amrute's idea makes it evident that tech or digital colonialism is a continuation of past patterns of exploitation and dominance rather than just a metaphor. The tech industry's extractive, exploitative, and hierarchical strategies have elements of old-style colonialism, which nourishes global inequality and strengthens the power relations between the Global North and the Global South. Gaining an understanding of these processes is essential to creating inclusive and equitable technological practices that actually benefit all people.</p>

            <p>My role in the South African development industry would be to aid in growing and improving the software industry locally and eventually being able to innovate new software that don’t require us to rely on the global North as much however, In South Africa's IT sector, the dominance of international tech companies could hinder local innovation. Developers may find it difficult to provide solutions that are specifically suited to the demands and difficulties of the South African market if they predominantly employ tools and platforms that are under the ownership of foreign corporations. This restricts the expansion of local innovation ecosystems and tech companies. This means that it will prove to continuously be a challenge to decolonise the tech space in South Africa.</p>

            <p>A role that one can play in decoloniality includes: education and awareness- Educate developers on the effects that colonization has had and will continue to have on technology. Promote thoughtful consideration of the biases present in software. This can also include educating myself on these issues surrounding digital colonialism and writing and sharing my thoughts and ideas. Community engagement-Interact with marginalized groups, such as Indigenous communities, to get insight into their needs, viewpoints, and beliefs. Work together during the development process to make sure their priorities are met, and their opinions are heard. Decentralization and Localization- supporting regional and decentralized software solutions can help you challenge the hegemony of Western-centric technology. Promote the creation of technology that is considerate of indigenous knowledge systems and tailored to local circumstances. Promoting innovation amongst software developers in the country and sharing one’s solutions and ideas to certain issues. These are just a few examples that we can look at to aid in the decolonisation of technology.</p>

            <p>This essay has highlighted what digital colonialism is using Amrute’s article as a framework as well as referencing academic sources to help aid the discussion and further explain the concept and how it impacts labour situations globally and locally (South Africa). Although there are solutions and ideas to aid in mitigating digital colonialism, the discussion has shown that it will take a while to shift away from the colonialism nature of the globe and decolonise the tech/digital space.</p>
