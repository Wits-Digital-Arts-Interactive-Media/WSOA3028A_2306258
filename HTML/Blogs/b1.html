My experience setting up GitHub was quite alright because I have experience with setting up a GitHub repo. Publishing on pages wasn’t too bad as well as I am familiar with the process. It does become a bit stressful when publishing pages because the page you put up will not always look the way you want it to in terms of sizing, and placements- just the general look of your website, which does make it a bit challenging to get the dimensions right.
The reading I engaged with this week was the Wardrip-Fruin reading on ‘What hypertext is?’ This reading was quite interesting to engage with because it opened a new view of what exactly is hypertext, before engaging with the reading I always thought hypertext was a link that I clicked on that redirected me to a new page (i.e another website or a different page on a website). I learned what hypermedia refers to which is interesting because I wouldn’t have thought that an example of hypermedia is the World Wide Web. Although this read was interesting and I learned new information, it was quite difficult to understand because it didn’t exactly explain what hypertext is, it simply highlights the forms of hypermedia/hypertext. It would require me to read the article multiple times more and engage with other people's thoughts and ideas to fully grasp the reading.
A fun task I did this week was researching fun facts about the internet and I learned so much about the internet not so much its history. The first fact was learning the meaning of ‘CAPTCHA’- I had no idea what it meant even though I’d seen it multiple times when surfing the internet. Another one was also learning that WI-FI is not an acronym which I found strange because, in today’s world, a lot of tech stuff has acronyms. Learning these new fun facts led to me asking the question of why things are the way they are in terms of the internet which was a question I had never asked myself before.
My goals for the course are firstly to pass but to improve and solidify my fundamental skills in terms of website design. I believe I still have room to grow and to boost my confidence when it comes to producing work that showcases my skills in all aspects of website design. I would also like to explore ideas I have further.
